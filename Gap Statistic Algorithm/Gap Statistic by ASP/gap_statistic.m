%   FUNCTION
%   Gap Statistic v1.0 (gap_statistic.m)
%
%   DESCRIPTION
%   This function is designed to compute the optimum number of ks using the
%   Gap Statistic algorithm (Tibshirani, Walther & Hastie, 2001; a great
%   introduction can be found in Edwin Chen's blog). The reference datasets
%   are created from uniform distributions. Note: we use the phrases
%   'reference data(set)' and 'test data(set)' as synonymies in the code.
%
%   INPUTS
%   data: 2D dataset where each column is a variable.
%   k_vector: a vector with the ks to test.
%   n_test: number of test-datasets that have to be generated.
%   n_cores: the number of cores used in the computation; leave it null if
%   you miss the Parallel Computing Toolbox.
%
%   OUTPUTS
%   opt_k: the optimum k, that is the one that gaves the max gap.
%   gaps: 1-by-max_k array containing the gaps for all the ks tested.
