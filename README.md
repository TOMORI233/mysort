### 1. Introduction

This sorting method is simply based on PCA and K-means.

**By now, overlapping spikes are ignored.**

`mysort` is for TDT Block data in .mat format. It should contain at least fields named `streams` or `snips`. `streams` should contain fields named `Wave`, which contains fields `data` (a m\*n matrix of entire recorded waves, channels along row), `fs` (sampling rate, in Hz) and `channel` (a m\*1 vector specifying channel numbers). `snips` should contain fields named `data` (a m\*p matrix of waveforms of spikes, waveform channel number along row and waveform points along column), `fs`, `chan` (a m\*1 vector specifying channel number of each waveform).

### 2. Instructions

Before you start using `mysort`, you should first download `MATLABUtils` and add it to your matlab path.

```git
git clone git@github.com:TOMORI233/MATLABUtils.git
```

The latest supported version is MATLAB 2019b.

#### 2.1 Mysort

See `mysort.m` for more detailed information.

1. To add `mysort` to your MATLAB path, in MATLAB command line type in

```matlab
>> addpath(genpath(your root path/mysort))
>> savepath
```

2. To sort your single-channel TDT block data

You can first use:

```matlab
sortResult = mysort(data, [], "origin"); % If K is left blank, an optimum K will be used
```

This will sort spike waveforms of your original block data using an optimum K generated by Gap Statistic for K-means.

If you are not satisfied with the original spike waveform length, you can specify `waveLength` in `mysort.m` and use:

```matlab
sortResult = mysort(data, [], "origin-reshape");
```

If you want to reselect a threshold for spikes, use:

```matlab
sortResult = mysort(data, [], "reselect");
```

Or use

```matlab
sortResult = mysort(data); % default, same with mysort(data, [], "reselect")
```

This will plot a time-wave curve of at most 100 seconds for preview. When a threshold (in volts) is input in MATLAB command line, the sorting process continues. For multi-channel sorting, `th` is required for every channel.

Still not satisfied? You can specify `CVCRThreshold` (cumulative variance contribution rate threshold, default: 0.9) for PC dimensions selection or convergence condition for K-means in `mKmeans.m` (usually a minimum ratio of relative cluster center shift in Euclidean distance, default: 0.1).

Also you can use MATLAB `pca` and `kmeans` functions instead of `mPCA` and `mKmeans` in `spikeSorting.m`.

3. To sort your multi-channel TDT block data

You can specify channels to sort with the second parameter of `mysort`. Usually `channels` is a vector containing the channel numbers to be sorted one by one. If it is left empty, all channels will be sorted.

```matlab
% data has 32 channels of waves
channels = [1, 2, 14, 20];
sortResult = mysort(data, channels, "reselect"); % sort channel 1,2,14,20 only
sortResult = mysort(data, [], "reselect"); % sort all 32 channels
sortResult = mysort(data, channels, "origin-reshape"); % sort original spike waveforms
```

4. If you consider some clusters as redundant ones, you can specify a K like this:

```matlab
sortResult = mysort(data, channels, "reselect", K); % specify a K
sortResult = mysort(data, channels, "reselect", "gap"); % default: use gap statistic to find an optimum K
sortResult = mysort(data, channels, "reselect", "elbow"); % use elbow method to find an optimum K
sortResult = mysort(data, channels, "reselect", "both"); % use gap statistic but also cal elbow method
sortResult = mysort(data, channels, "reselect", "preview"); % preview 3-D PCA data and input a K
```

5. For more detailed settings, specify your own `sortOpts` as the last parameter input of `mysort`. See `defaultConfig.m` in folder `config` for more information about `sortOpts`.

```matlab
sortResult = mysort(..., sortOpts);
```

6. To view result, use:

```matlab
plotSSEorGap(sortResult); % select an optimum K
plotPCA(sortResult, [1, 2, 3]); % view clusters in 3-D PCA space. Also you can specify the second parameter with  a 2-element vector, which will show clusters in 2-D PCA space (default: [1 2]).
plotWave(sortResult); % view waves and templates of different clusters
plotSpikeAmp(sortResult); % spike amplitude distribution histogram
plotNormalizedSSE(sortResult); % histogram of normalized SSE of each template on each cluster
```

#### 2.2 Template Matching

Template matching is based on sum of square error of normalized spike PCA data and template PCA data. With critical value (*cv*) at prominence level *p*, define waveforms with *SSE* > *cv* as noise.

In some case, you have several recordings of different protocols from one cell. Usually the spike waveforms among files are the same. You can sort one file using `mysort` and apply `templateMatching` to other files.

To sort a long recording, you can also sort a small part of it at first and apply `templateMatching` to the rest premised on cell invariance.

```matlab
% 1. Sort data0 with mysort
sortResult0 = mysort(data0);

% 2. Match templates of data0 in data1
sortResult1 = templateMatching(data1, sortResult0);
```

#### 2.3 Sort with other data struct

`batchSorting` is for waves or waveforms from any recording platform. For multi-channel data, it runs in loops of sorting every single channel, considering each channel to be independent.

```matlab
% Specify your own sorting options
run('defaultConfig.m');
sortOpts = defaultSortOpts;

% 1. Use raw wave data
% waves is an m*n matrix, with channels along row and sampling points along column
% channels is an m*1 column vector, which specifies the channel number of each wave sample
result = batchSorting(waves, channels, sortOpts);

% Or
% 2. Use extracted waveforms
% Waveforms is an m*n matrix, with channels along row and waveform points along column
% channels is an m*1 column vector, which specifies the channel number of each waveform
result = batchSorting([], channels, sortOpts, Waveforms);
```

#### 2.4 Re-cluster

`recluster` is for merging and splitting in 2-D PCA view. You can generate a polygon to select spikes whose cluster index you want to alter. After selection, right click the PCA view and click `confirm` to continue with your work. Or you can also preview waveforms, PCA, spike amplitude and SSE of the selected region, and redo the selection if unsatisfied.

```matlab
result = mysort(data);
v = validateInput(["non-negative", "integer"], "Please input a cluster number for reclustering: ");
% 1 - Exclude noise from selected points
selectedIdx = recluster(result, [1, 2]);
result.clusterIdx(selectedIdx & ~logical(result.noiseClusterIdx)) = v;
% 2 - Multi-dimension selection
selectedIdx1 = recluster(result, [1, 2]);
selectedIdx2 = recluster(result, [2, 3]);
result.clusterIdx(selectedIdx1 & selectedIdx2 & ~logical(result.noiseClusterIdx)) = v;
```

### 3. Algorithm

#### 3.1 PCA and K-means

See [docs](docs\PRINCIPLE.md) for detailed information about PCA and K-means algorithm.

#### 3.2 Template matching

Template matching is based on sum of square error of normalized spike PCA data and template PCA data. With critical value (*cv*) at prominence level *p*, define waveforms with *SSE* > *cv* as noise.

First, extract spikes and their waveforms from raw data using sorting options of `sortResult0`, which is the sorting result generated by `mysort` functions.

Second, apply PCA on `[Waveforms; templates]`, where `Waveforms` is waveform data to sort and `templates` is template waveforms of `sortResult0`.

Third, normalize PCA result column by column (along PCs).

Forth, compute *SSE* of each spike in each cluster.

Fifth, find the smallest-*SSE* cluster index for each spike.

```matlab
% SSE definition
% pcaData_norm is normalized pca data. C_norm is normalized cluster center in pca.
for kIndex = 1:K
	SSE_norm(:, kIndex) = sum((pcaData_norm - C_norm(kIndex, :)).^2, 2);
end
```
