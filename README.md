### Instructions

1. To add `mysort` to your MATLAB path, in MATLAB command line type in

```matlab
>> addpath(genpath(your root path/mysort))
>> savepath
```

2. To sort your single-channel TDT block data

You can first use:

```matlab
sortResult = mysort(data, "origin");
```

This will sort spikes of your original block data using an optimum K generated by Gap Statistic for K-means. If you consider some clusters as redundant ones, you can specify a K for this:

```matlab
K = 3; % You can select a K according to PCA raster or K-SSEs / K-gaps curve, 3 for example
sortResult = mysort(data, "origin", K);
```

If you want to reselect a threshold for spikes, use (if K is left blank, an optimum K will be used):

```matlab
sortResult = mysort(data, "reselect");
```

This will plot a time-wave curve of at most 30 seconds for preview. When a threshold (in volts) is input in MATLAB command line, the sorting process continues.
